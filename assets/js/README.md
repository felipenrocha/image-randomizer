// Questions about project:

1.  Remove black border of image box? (yes or no)
2.  The images have different sizes, we can do somethings about this, which one do u prefer (1 or 2 or 3):
    2.1. resize the image to fit in the box (looks bad and stretched)
    2.2  resize the box to dynamically change the height with the image height (i guess its best idk)
    2.3  if the image is smaller than the box, i can repeat her multiple times (im doing this one rn) (not responsive in mobile)

3. Whats the font used in the text around the image? 


// observations

i dont think ill be able to animate a text that rotates around the image

// TODO: work to do still besides the questions above: (after lunch)(for me only)

1. Images responsive
1. Put text on side of images
2. Format navbar to be responsive and @ middle of page
3. Page that lists all images
